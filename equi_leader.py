"""
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

An equi leader is an i S such that 0 â‰¤ S < N - 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] have leaders of the same value.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2
we can find two equi leaders:

0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.
